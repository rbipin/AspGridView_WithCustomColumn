# AspGridView WithCustomColumn
This project is a sample code to create a custom column in the Aspx Grid view with text box and button using only template field and not the edit item template.
This Sample project has a local database where it updates and also gets the data from. If the data for that column is already available then it will display it, otherwise you may update that column.
